# A Brief Introduciton
 **Name:** Camryn  
 **Age:** 19  
 **Occupation:** Student  
 **Bio:**  
 I'm from Lee's Summit, which is a suburb of Kansas City, Missouri. I originally chose to attend Mizzou because of the journalism program. I was convinced that I wanted
 to be a journalist or author, because honestly I didn't think I was good at much else besides writing. However, one of my three brothers, Austin, encouraged me to look
 into UX Design, for it is a constantly growing field and has the creativity and stability that I want in a career. At first I had decided against it, thinking that it would bore me, however, after some thought, I decided that it was the best path for me. At first it was because I didn't want to lose my love of writing because it felt like a chore, and it would be too difficult to let go of something I held so dearly. But later, I found that I actually really enjoyed learning IT, and now it's something that I think I will always be interested in.
